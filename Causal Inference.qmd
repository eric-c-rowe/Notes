## DAGS

Useful R package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-ggdag.html

Types of relationships:

* Pipe: A -> C -> B
* Fork: A <- C -> B
* Collider: A -> C <- B

Conditioning on C for the pipe/fork will remove the causal path from A to B
Condition on C for the collider will open a (non-causal) path from A to B

Montgomery et. al 2018, "How Conditioning on Postreatment Variables can Ruin Your Experiment"

Key point: sometimes adding control variables will create confounding, particularly when conditioning on a collider. Need to guide your analysis with something like a DAG.
